1amdrm9,02-09-2024 02:48:28,How the USSR helped visible minorities in Canada. Particularly Asians,"In John Price's book ""Orienting Canada""  he details the panic of DEA (Canadian dept of external affairs at the time) officials surrounding the standing of the Soviet Union amongst the colonized peoples of the world.

At the time, Canada had some of the most draconian and racist laws in place specifically targeting Asian communities. Asians were not allowed to vote and Japanese Canadians had been forcefully displaced from their homes and livelihoods in BC and placed in concentration camps east of the Rockies or deported to a Japan they had never even been to. Leading up to WWII the Canadian government constantly lowered its quota on Japanese immigrants bottoming out at around 150 per year by 1940. 

Following the war and the efforts undertaken by both the Chinese and Japanese-Canadian communities in supporting the war effort the government soon realized defending its existing legislation was untenable. But not solely because of internal pressure as noted by DEA officials in the following;

> ""The Soviet Union is today posing as the principal defender of the rights of coloured and colonial peoples. It is also posing as the principal defender of the sovereignty of small powers. It would seem probable that, if the Western powers are unable to remove racial discriminations rapidly and to satisfy the demands of colonial peoples for self-government, the Western powers may have the great majority of the colonial and coloured peoples hostile or unfriendly to them in the event of war with the Soviet Union."" 

The Asian-Canadians would finally win the franchise in 1948 with the repealing of the Chinese exclusion act.

Western governments have known all along that communism stands to benefit the majority of mankind. And yet, not long after the end of the second world War the US and friends (Canada too) would go on to declare a world wide war against communist ""tyranny"".",,Submission,74,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadaleft/comments/1amdrm9/how_the_ussr_helped_visible_minorities_in_canada/,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadaleft/comments/1amdrm9/how_the_ussr_helped_visible_minorities_in_canada/,"""None""","""International solidarity \u270a""",0.15158679,0.003108978,0.014771583,0.10757765,0.061451588,0.008298059,0.073550725,0.08,0.107,0.813,-0.8635,N/A,N/A,N/A,en

1964q97,01-14-2024 02:10:02,Historical proof of Canadian Liberals' alignment with Fascism,"Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King met with Goering and Hitler himself during a visit to Nazi Germany on 29 June, 1937. He had nothing short of a man crush on Hitler, describing in uncomfortably great detail the features of Hitlers physique that King admired. But most notable in King's diaries is his high praise for the Nazis actions up to that point. Describing Hitlers work as ""constructive"" and going so far as to say "" I hope that work might continue"" and ""nothing would be permitted to destroy that work."" And, finally, ""That it was bound to be followed in other countries to the benefit of mankind."" It should be noted that King toured Berlin, and would have seen the Jews there marked with the yellow star.

In case it's not clear what King is referencing here he is talking about the violent suppression of the German left, including massacres and mass imprisonment of Communists which is evidenced later in the conversation when Hitler is justifying his actions by essentially saying Germany would have met the same fate as Spain had he not killed and imprisoned the communists in Germany. Spain, of course, being embroiled in a brutal civil war between leftists and the Fascist Franco backed by Mussolini and Hitler. King then goes on to write ""While he was talking in this way, I confess I felt he was using exactly the same argument as I had used in the Canadian Parliament last session."" Communists were, of course, closely associated with eastern Europeans and Russians who, at the time, were considered ""lesser"" on the Canadian establishments hierarchy and viewed as dangerous animals.

Hitler and King then talk back and forth a bit about the English position on the rise of Germany. King flat out says the expansion of Germany is justified and that the British empire has no problems with Germany so long as it doesn't interfere with British interests, meaning...As long as Hitler kept to killing communists in Eastern Europe, everyone could get along.

Another undercurrent here was antisemitism. It's no secret Canada was wildly antisemitic. What is a secret is that it was probably \*the\* MOST antisemitic country in the world behind Nazi Germany. Canada admitted just over 5000 Jewish refugees between 1933-1945. The lowest total of any allied country BY FAR. By comparison the US took in over 200,000. In 1938, due to pressure regarding the acceptance of Jewish refugees King wrote “My own feeling is that nothing is to be gained by creating an internal problem in an effort to meet an international one.” He also expressed concern in  “intermixture of foreign strains of blood.” Despite the fact...you know....Canada being a settler state built through genocide committed by foreign invaders and all.  In 1936 director of Immigration Frederick Blair called for the need to be ""realistic about Canada’s immigration needs and about the unsuitability of the Jew to those needs.” Jews were also, again, closely tied to communism. The tragedy of the St.Louis just epitomizes the whole saga. The global threat of Judeo-Bolshevism was Hitlers bread and butter and the sentiment was shared across the imperial core. Peoples revolutions scared the ever living fuck out of the Canadian establishment. So they jumped on the fascist bandwagon enthusiastically. And Canadas actions post-war are nothing short of tyrannical.

This sort of racialized rhetoric is constant in every episode of Canadian history. I just chose this particular period to highlight that, even in one of ""Canada greatest moments"" things were not as clear as ""good vs evil"" and Canadas motives were not for the benefit of the average working human. It also demonstrates that ideologically, the Canadian establishment and indeed the entire capitalist establishment very closely resembled that of Nazi Germany. And still does, as they share the same interests of ensuring the working class stays in a position of subservience to the rich.",,Submission,51,0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadaleft/comments/1964q97/historical_proof_of_canadian_liberals_alignment/,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadaleft/comments/1964q97/historical_proof_of_canadian_liberals_alignment/,"""None""","""None""",0.17025198,0.006141663,0.022628209,0.094936445,0.07333439,0.011560392,0.027550505050505054,0.109,0.123,0.768,-0.9619,N/A,N/A,N/A,en

197imeq,01-15-2024 20:15:14,"Once Israel moves out of Gaza, what position do we want the Canadian government to take?","I understand that right now ending the genocide occurring in Gaza is front of mind, but I’m looking to better understand what the best solution is for Palestinians long term. From my point of view, a single state solution with both Israeli’s and Palestinians living alongside each other will only lead to continued oppression of Palestinians. For this reason, a two state solution where Palestinians can self-govern and not be policed by Israel seems like the only viable solution. I know that this isn’t the opinion of a lot of pro-Palestinian activists and Palestinians though, so I want to hear some more perspectives. 

Do you think a single state solution is the path most likely to achieve peace in the middle east and improve the quality of life for Palestinians? 

If we support a single state solution, what other conditions should we be advocating for to prevent a return to the pre Oct 07 oppression of Palestinians? 

Are there other countries made up of two groups at such odds with one another where a one state solution can be considered ""successful"" and without considerable conflict/oppression? 

Looking for any articles/podcasts to learn more about these perspectives and educate myself on the issue.

ETA: Thank you for all the perspectives/resources shared so far! I know some people have taken issue with my assumption that Israel moves out of Gaza. I guess I could’ve reworded that as ""ceases fire"" in Gaza. I’m not an expert but based on what I’ve heard from various experts on foreign affairs it does seem likely that the fighting will stop soon. Public perception has shifted since Oct 07, there’s the South Africa genocide case, and Western countries are looking for an end to the war ASAP now that it’s affecting trade routes. Based on this, I think it’s more likely than not that the fighting ends soon and any Israeli ground troops in Gaza leave. Maybe they’ll return and settle Gaza, maybe they won’t settle there in an effort to push for a two state solution, this isn’t really what I’m here to argue about. I apologize if my wording is objectionable to you, I just meant to ask what’s best long term.

It's on FB, in places that it wasn't before. It's in all the canada subs (already not known for their nuance) on reddit. Like the first comment. It's in ALL the twitter threads. It's just so blatant and so repetitive. Like it's gotta be a majority bots because the comments are so similar, but it's also so stark. It is trying to sound so reasonable, like it's an inarguable fact. 

Anyway. Kinda wish we could focus on where this is coming from instead of the supposed increase in antisemitism. Because, yeah, the first comment on any news about a pro-palestine protest is now automatically ""send them back where they came from"" when it's actually not new immigrants that are particularly concerned with palestine rights. The two things feel connected somehow but anyway, it does not feel organic somehow.

17zf45u,11-20-2023 03:24:36,What explains the Canada-Cuba connection?,"Canada is part of the US imperial apparatus. It is a racist, neoliberal-colonial state whose economic and geopolitical interests are, for the most part, intertwined with US imperialism. 

Canada is almost like a 51st state, and despite Canadians' insistence on being considered better than America, Canada is nothing more than a neoliberal-corporate state just like the US (in fact, our transition to neoliberalism in the 90s was arguably more extreme than that of America).

On some fronts, Canada has diverged from US foreign policy in unexpected ways. Examples include the Vietnam War and the Iraq War.

But perhaps the most bizarre example of Canada's occasional divergence from US foreign policy is the Republic of Cuba. 

After the Cuban Revolution, Canada did not sever diplomatic ties with Cuba and immediately recognized the Republic of Cuba on January 8th, 1959 (the same day the rebels took Havana). In fact, diplomatic ties between Canada and Cuba were not at all interrupted by the Revolution. 

John Diefenbaker, a literal Tory, was rather apathetic about the Revolution in Cuba and did not feel the need to compromise economics or diplomatic ties. 

And then there was the famous visit by the Trudeaus in 1976 to Cuba, which threw a wrench into in Canada-US relations.

Even Harper, arguably our most batshit insane right-wing PM ever, wanted ""engagement"" rather than ""continued isolation"".

And of course, Canada does not participate in the American imperial blockade on Cuba. In fact, trade between Canada and Cuba is significant. Canada is Cuba's second-largest export partner. Canada also funds various development projects in Cuba.

176y3d9,10-13-2023 12:54:42,Palestine,"If you don't know the whole truth, here's a historical summary to clarify some points:

‎The war that has been going on between Israel and Palestine is not a war between two countries, therefore, the attack by the Palestinian resistance is not a declaration of war but rather a reaction to the violations that have been happening for more than 70 years against the Palestinian people.

‎For more than a century, the Palestinian territories belonged to the Ottoman Empire. During the First World War, as the Ottomon Empire weakened, the United Kingdom occupied Palestine.

‎In 1917, the British Foreign Secretary, in a letter to Lionel Rothschild, declared his full support for the formation of a Jewish state in the Palestinian territories. We call it “a promise from someone who has nothing to someone who doesn't deserve it”.

‎At the beginning of the implementation of this fateful promise, the number of Jews in Palestine was 7%. After the immigration of European Jews to the British protectorate, the total Jewish population in Palestine grew to 28%.

‎After World War II, the UN issued a resolution for the partition of Palestine between Arabs and Jews in 1947.

‎On May 14, 1948, Israeli leaders met at the Tel Aviv museum and announced the end of the British occupation of Palestine and the establishment of the state of Israel, recognized by the Soviet Union and the United States.

‎The 1948 war:
‎Many Arab countries rejected the unjust occupation of Palestine and its division by the United States. After successive wars with US support, Israel occupied larger areas than those initially envisaged by the United States.

‎Many Palestinian organizations, armed and unarmed, fought together for the liberation of their state, which was unjustly divided and occupied.

‎Violations against Palestinians are committed daily and systematically. There are more than 100 thousand registered martyrs, twice that number has not been counted and there are more than a million dead.

‎Violations are carried out in various aspects of life, including education, health, supplies that are constantly cut off, violations of religious sanctities and provocations on Palestinian commemorative dates and holidays.

‎Israel does not intend to give the Palestinians peace, and does not want a Palestinian state to be established near “its” lands. The Palestinian area is shrinking daily while territories controlled by Israel are expanding.

‎Google the neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrahm and you will see Palestinian violations and Israeli occupations. The Palestinian reaction is just a reaction to daily violations, which are not reported as much as they should be.

‎If you are a free person, you will certainly not accept all this hypocrisy and distortion of facts by the international community. Pray for Palestine and support Palestine.",,Submission,32,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadaleft/comments/176y3d9/palestine/,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadaleft/comments/176y3d9/palestine/,"""None""","""None""",0.17371799,0.007171631,0.064458095,0.15945168,0.056133457,0.043955702,0.10226190476190475,0.113,0.135,0.752,-0.9577,N/A,N/A,N/A,en

Originally prompted by the horrible news of the Israeli Occupation Forces bombing a hospital in Gaza, killing 500, we have seen the horrific murder of over 11,000 (and counting) civilians in Gaza and will no doubt see countless more due to the siege preventing food, water, medicine, fuel, electricity, internet, etc from reaching the populace. The CanadaLeft mod team reaffirms **our unflinching solidarity and support for the people of Palestine and especially Gaza at this time.** We are seeing yet another textbook case of a settler-colonial project genociding a people for their land the same way it has been happening on Turtle Island. 

Thankfully, it's great to see the outpouring of support by the majority of users of /r/CanadaLeft, but we would like to make it very clear to the minority that we will not tolerate people spreading Zionist myths and lies about the origin of Israel, its countless war crimes, its Apartheid system, and its active genocide against Palestinian people.

If you are someone uninformed or someone naively ""both sides""-ing this conflict we urge you to get educated. There's plenty of resources available, such as, [Human Rights Watch's report on Israel's Apartheid](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution),
Abby Martin's coverage of Palestine: [Palestine 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEUIR_JG_b8), [Inside Palestine's Refugee Camps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxvNZisaB8E) or the in-depth reading lists of [Decolonize Palestine](https://decolonizepalestine.com/reading-list/) and [the Palestinian Youth Movement](https://palestinianyouthmovement.com/reading-list).

I work for a really big recruitment agency that works with companies that employ about 30% of the workforce in Canada, think of the biggest companies you can think of and you will be guessing it right.

This whole week has been us sitting with executives of these companies along with lawyers and making a plan to push for LMIA for entry-level to mid-level employees in the upcoming year or 2. This is not replacement necessarily but since they cannot retain talent for the shit pay they give to people, they are investing millions in lobbying, and paying millions in fees to recruit candidates from around the world who are okay working with minimum pay instead of paying people their fair share. These companies make millions and millions in profit if not more every year.

I cannot back the Lobbying claim, but with the millions they are pouring in to make sure we do not hire a single candidate in Canada, I would not be surprised if they are also lobbying for this in the parliament.

I have been working in this industry all my life and dealt with my fair share of unrealistic demands, but this will change the landscape of this country. I am an immigrant myself but this is wild and I am certain that if these companies are doing this, other companies will join soon.

 Even Harper moderated himself. Heck even Alberta went NDP for a while (though they covered center right). 

But in the last five years there has been a push to the right most end of the political spectrum. Around 2018 things just felt very odd.. the majority of premiers being elected were all conservatives. Alberta and Ontario started turning out wannabe Trumps.

1601qi4,08-24-2023 13:18:12,I don't think anyone has any idea how bad it is in this country to be poor,"Even on this subreddit the severity is underestimated. Or how much worse it is even compared to the U.S. there is also an under estimate of how bad labour laws are here. I think people in this sub are aware a bit but maybe not educated enough on just how bad things are for the poor.

I've known people who have taken their own lives due to poverty. As a child in Harris Era ontario I nearly starved to death and had childhood friends succumb to pneumonia at 10 from living in severe poverty and totally lacking nutrition and heat. I developed rickets when I was 9 years old. My mother was on OW. We lived on less than a dollar a day.

As a young adult my employment opportunities were limited. There were few jobs paying above minimum wage (which was 10 bucks) in my community and rmployers were discrimination to me due to my mild ASD. Granted baack then thre was ZERO disability production. This was about 2009-2010. I had more disabled friends end up homeless or suicide than I can count. It was so bad that I no longer associate either anyone with a disability due to the fact that the potential for suicide is so high in this province for us that I can't bear the heart break. 

The worst suicide I ever experienced was of of a Croation  immigrant woman pregnant with twins I worked with unloading boxes at the beer store with suicide by poisoning herself. She was being evicted and her partner had left her. 
 It was awful.

I should also say all grants and loans have been cut to shreds in canada. I currently work as a cart pusher and will have to personally finance my own education as osap is so pitiful. 

Things are BAD!!!@",,Submission,282,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadaleft/comments/1601qi4/i_dont_think_anyone_has_any_idea_how_bad_it_is_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadaleft/comments/1601qi4/i_dont_think_anyone_has_any_idea_how_bad_it_is_in/,"""None""","""Discussion""",0.14256015,0.006408691,0.078378424,0.062039822,0.061801232,0.015256803,-0.106389961,0.04,0.268,0.691,-0.9987,N/A,N/A,N/A,en

15smjuh,08-16-2023 10:54:24,Most Canadian Millennial's are very poor. The middle class is older and the wealthy are foreigners.,"I'm 33 and I don't know a single person who can buy a house in Ontario. Everyone I know is employed but what they make isn't much more than their rent. My sister is a nurse and only clears 6k a month after taxes and her rent is 2,500 and going up (1 bedroom). She's a high income earner according to the government. She will never get a mortgage in this province though. 

The ''middle class'' is made up of entirely Gen X and Boomers. I'm telling you. millennial's are NOT living a middle class lifestyle (as we imagine it) unless they're born wealthy or a specialist MD (brain surgeon level salary). 

The modern ''wealthy'' in Ontario especially are foreign born millionaire's who came to Canada to park their money in real estate. I was in yorkdale shopping center last week - 90% of the people carrying ''shopping bags from designer stores'' in that mall were Asian, Arab and what seemed like Russian whites (heard the slavic language). 

Also a few well off Jewish people. Black people, Indian people and regular whites were absent. You'll see the same crowd from high end car dealerships according to people I know - the same wealthy ethnic groups and largely foreign born. This is pretty disturbing as this is not ''made in canada'' wealth - most people will never become rich in Canada. But Canada caters to wealthy foreigners. The absolute majority of Canada's wealthy foreign class is Asian based on my visual survey now and over the years. 

Sure, I'm sure there's a few wealthy snobby white's in Toronto who made their money as MD's and business owners but their wealth PALES in comparison to that of rich Asians, Arabs and Russians - some of which are billionaire's.

The future is feudal at this point.

Edit: The only ''self made'' person I know is a Gen X Jewish dermatologist. He treated my skin condition and we kept in touch and became friends. He grew up without significant wealth as a child.  He's well off enough to buy a house and vacation but really not that rich to be honest. He's considered ''super successful'' with a 400K income before taxes but he's not incredibly wealthy.

Edit again: and if you didn't think anti-black racism wasn't an issue in Canada the majority of my well educated black friends are working WAY BELOW their skill level. It's sickening.",,Submission,50,0.62,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadaleft/comments/15smjuh/most_canadian_millennials_are_very_poor_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadaleft/comments/15smjuh/most_canadian_millennials_are_very_poor_the/,"""None""","""Discussion""",0.23812068,0.00492096,0.03765389,0.116281845,0.16831873,0.006938754,0.1161706349206349,0.169,0.066,0.764,0.9948,N/A,N/A,N/A,en

15h8ywz,08-03-2023 16:34:35,On The Inevitable Upcoming Election,"Some guy made a post about a poll earlier and I was a bit triggered that evening so I kind of popped off a bit and called them a liberal (sorry lol)

Pretty sure I got blocked by them, so I couldn't clarify this morning when I woke up with a clear head and I thought I might make a post about this issue because it is worth discussing.

Ultimately I do vote, you can't really vote federally for any of the Communist Parties right now they are mostly defunct and don't really do anything that would be a waste. I think there's a socialist caucus in the NDP, but I'm not sure. Anyway, my main point is that none of the main parties really are working in the interest of the proletariat nor do we have a vanguard party.

Voting federally is really just about the slight chance of getting a party who will MAYBE soften the blow of capitalism on a small fraction of the population with state welfare but ultimately still represent the bourgeoisie state and imperialism. Trudeau still built pipelines, bought weapons from Saudi Arabia, does the bare minimum to criticize Israel, and is intent on supporting NATO's imperialist proxy war in Ukraine...

What I want to say is that we can have a much greater impact focusing on our communities and less on the dog and pony show that is the federal government. Feed the unhoused, volunteer, demonstrate, canvas for and support leftist councilors etc. Not much will change for regular people between governments at the end of the day the levels of oppression maybe change by a fraction, it's up to us to make the changes we want in our communities.

I've yet to find fellow ML where I live, but I've been involved in two strike demonstrations and a community housing advocacy group. I actually saw a post recently where a student was housed for $300 a month!

Anyway, when the election comes leftists are naturally gonna start getting feeling pretty down. The cycle of blue and red is oppressive and exhausting... but we still have the power to build leftist infrastructure and spread class consciousness.",,Submission,30,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadaleft/comments/15h8ywz/on_the_inevitable_upcoming_election/,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadaleft/comments/15h8ywz/on_the_inevitable_upcoming_election/,"""None""","""None""",0.17198499,0.004997253,0.0715894,0.043581683,0.082866095,0.011146127,0.086663059,0.114,0.068,0.818,0.9447,N/A,N/A,N/A,en

10srtf2,02-03-2023 18:45:42,The truth about capitalism.,"Under capitalism the suffering is the point of the entire social order. Its entire purpose is the extraction of value from all human enterprise for the benefit of a few wealthy individuals. 

Because social orders organized in this way require the majority of the people living under them to spend their labour and other social interactions serving the interests of the capitalist value-extracting class. It is important to maintain a power differential between the members of the capitalist class and the working class. Not only is it in the capitalist interest keep the worker at a low standard of living compared to the capitalist luxury, it is even more critical that they equate the interests of capitalists with worker. Even though under minor logical scrutiny, it can be shown that the interests of both classes are fundamentally and materially in opposition. 

In order to grow and expand the reach of imperialist capital. The working class must be brought into a specific psychological state. One that elevates the state to a god like status above any moral accountability. The purpose of this psychology is to promote the fear of violence from foreign people and governments. This fear is used as an excuse to Invade foreign lands to secure valuable resources for capital penetration, or use espionage and subterfuge to destabilize governments for the same purpose. 
You can’t make people dedicate their lives to serve the interests of a capitalist class whose material interests are furthered by the oppression of the people, unless you use the power of the state to protect the interests of the capitalists who extract value from all human enterprise.",,Submission,33,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadaleft/comments/10srtf2/the_truth_about_capitalism/,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadaleft/comments/10srtf2/the_truth_about_capitalism/,"""None""","""None""",0.06579731,0.001773834,0.017094411,0.016963007,0.026831545,0.007158832,0.05462963,0.156,0.06,0.784,0.9664,N/A,N/A,N/A,en

1083p51,01-10-2023 07:26:02,"As a Left Anti-Imperialist, I Used to Defend Iran's Dictatorship","It seemed only reasonable, looking at the US's record of hypocrisy, invasion, and regime change around the world. Any foreign government they criticized, even Iran's theocracy, must be more complex than America's simple propaganda claimed.

And at times, over the last 40-odd years, that may have been true. But in more recent years, the so-called 'Islamic Republic' has shown enough hatred for its own people to have lost all remaining legitimacy. They are now a fully criminal organization and fake-religious cult, not a sovereign government.

When Ukrainian Airlines flight 752 was shot down in 2020 by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ('Sepah' in Iran), IRI authorities bulldozed the crash site (intentionally destroying evidence) and allowed the looting of the dead passengers' luggage and valuables. Throughout their twisting and changing explanations for why they shot down the plane, and left the skies open after firing missiles at a US base in Iraq, the one constant was their harassment and contempt for the survivors' families.

We still don't know the full truth behind this atrocity, but the IRI's actions at every stage have obstructed the course of justice. The head of Sepah has also said they don't regret the crime, and there's the suspicious fact that US citizen passengers were barred from the plane before flight 752 took off.

And last fall, after all that, Mahsa Amini was murdered by the ""Guidance Patrol"" morality police. Arrested, in 2022, for not wearing a cloth on her head the way the government said she should. According to witnesses in the police van, she resisted their degrading treatment, and a police thug kicked her in the head. This was a brutal enough blow that it caused internal bleeding, leading to her collapse and death only hours later.

In the months since, the dictatorship has killed hundreds of nonviolent protesters, and is now judicially murdering prisoners, in order to prove they didn't kill Mahsa Amini in the first place. This murdering cabal has no right to any Leftist's solidarity or defense. And if you want to know what that dictatorship really thinks of the Left, look at the IRI's history of savagely killing and suppressing Communists, Socialists, and trade unionists whenever they raise their heads (especially in the Iran-Iraq War period of the 1980s).

For whomever is reading this, as a Leftist in Canada I humbly ask you to join me in solidarity with Iran's protest movement. Forget the corporate media, forget Justin Trudeau, forget the US-based Iranian exiles who are often full of shit. Just listen to Iranians inside Iran, and recent immigrants all over Canada: people of all ages and backgrounds, people like us, and realize that they just want the same freedom and rights in life that the rest of the world enjoys. They deserve those rights as much as we do. They deserve our solidarity now in their hour of need.

Just some food for thought. The only way we can establish communism is through either a transitory state/temporary socialism after a revolution obviously, but for a revolution to happen, we need more class collaboration and class consciousness. NDP probably will never support revolutions. some how we need to wake up the masses, it's  gonna be tough. Since the Liberals and Conservatives are pretty much free market hypercapitalists. Support your local socialist politicians in local elections, obviously. but I don't think that will work, since most politicans stop at social democracy. this is why I think a revolution is needed because we can't rely on NDP anymore.

zv1yji,12-25-2022 17:06:27,My Analysis of foreign involvement on the war in Ukraine,"Good morning, everyone. I hope you all are enjoying your Christmas holidays and for those who find this time of year hard and not enjoyable, it's almost over.

I have come to the conclusion, through my research and scouring of journalistic sources, academic analysis, media broadcasts and official statements that the war in Ukraine was an intentional escalation against Russia by NATO, particularly the United States and that the Zelenskyy government is not in control of the Ukrainian government or its military but is, instead, a convenient figure head and a ""family friendly"" face used to hide the true face of Ukraine and appeal to the general public. Much like Winston Churchills leadership during WWII. This will also serve to show that Russias actions up to and including the February 2022 invasion weren't random acts carried out by an insane madman but were instead reactions to said provocations and were very much anticipated by the United States. This isn't to say these actions were justified or even necessary but simply to point out that the decisions all had very real reasons and logic behind them.

For the sake of brevity I will only be focusing on events starting in 2014 that directly lead to the Maidan coup and the overthrow of the Yanukovych government by Ukrainian far-right ultra national extremists and their support from the CIA and officials of the Obama administration.

Starting with the question of Ukraine's membership to NATO which has been at the very centre of tensions between Russia and NATO since the fall of the USSR in 1991. [Here](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1498491107902062592.html) is a thread compiled by analyst Arnaud Bertrand that quotes American diplomat and historian George Kennan stating in 1998 that NATO pushing into Ukraine would inevitably draw a negative reaction from Russia. Here is a relevant part of the quote from the above link; ""Of course there is going to be a bad reaction from Russia, and then the NATO expanders will say that is how we always told you the Russians are -- but this is just wrong."" The much loved (/s) Henry Kissinger also re-iterated in 2014 his opposition to Ukrainian NATO membership due to the confrontation it would draw with Russia. Russia has also been very open and honest, in this case, about its understandable fear of Ukrainian NATO membership due to the proximity of Ukraine to the Russian heartland and the arrival of the worlds most powerful military alliance on its doorstep is, again, understandably something they do not want.

[In 2010](https://www.bbc.com/news/10229626), upon his election victory Viktor Yanukovych immediately scrapped further plans to pursue NATO membership although he stated he would continue co-operation with the alliance and instead chose to focus on further integration with the EU. This article is significant for two reasons, first because it mentions polls taken in Ukraine actually showed Ukrainians were generally opposed to joining NATO and second by Ukraine avoiding NATO membership and instead focusing on EU relations it was an indirect statement to the United States saying telling them ""no"". As we will see, this is something the US could not tolerate.

I'm going to skip ahead to early 2014 here because things picked up really fast. [In February of 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5n8UbJ8jsk) a phone call was made between former Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs under Barak Obama, Victoria Nuland and former US Ambassador to Ukraine Jeffery Pyatt in which they discuss the upcoming coup and putting their chosen candidate, Arseniy Yatsenyuk in direct contact with the far-right Svoboda Party's leader, Oleh Tyahnybok and ensuring they talk at least 4 times a week. As well as Vitali Klitschko who has since been mayor of Kiev and a major ally of Ukrainian ultra-nationalists. Nuland ominously signs off by saying ""Fuck the EU."" [A transcript can be seen here.](https://kosmologelei.wordpress.com/2014/02/06/fuck-the-eu/) The original in english also appeared on the Washington post but was later scrubbed.

The following unrest and violence unleashed in Ukraine was perpetrated mainly by Neo-Nazi groups Right-Sector lead by Banderite Dmytro Yarosh, Svoboda lead by Oleh Tyahnybok and the Azov battalions lead by Andreyi Biletski. [An article released in 2018](https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2018/06/04/how-and-why-the-u-s-government-perpetrated-the-2014-coup-in-ukraine/) covered the extent of US involvement in the 2014 coup and, as well as the phone call mentioned above reveals a [second phone that call was recorded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEgJ0oo3OA8) shortly after the coup on 26 February, 2014 in which the foreign-affairs chief of the European Union, Catherine Ashton, was informed by her investigator, Estonian foreign Minister Urmas Paet, into his findings regarding what had been the cause of the violence that brought down the Ukrainian Government of President Viktor Yanukovych. [Transcript can be seen here.](https://archive.ph/IG1st#selection-2493.37-2493.300) The Estonian Minister goes on to say it became apparent it was far-right extremists who initiated and escalated the lethal violence that claimed the lives of most of the demonstrators and lead to the violence unleashed by the police.

In a 2015 book written by Ukrainian-Canadian political scientist Ivan Katchanovsk titled;  “The ‘Snipers’ Massacre’ on the Maidan in Ukraine” he writes;

\> ""*The massacre was a false flag operation, which was rationally planned and carried out with a goal of the overthrow of the government and seizure of power. It* \[his investigation\] *found various evidence of the involvement of an alliance of the far right organizations, specifically the Right Sector and Svoboda, and oligarchic parties.""*

American scholar Gordon M. Hahn also writes in his 2018 book ""Ukraine over the edge"";

\>\*“Yet another pro-Maidan sniper, Ivan Bubenchik, emerged to acknowledge that he shot and killed Berkut\* \[the Government’s police who were protecting Government buildings\] *before any protesters were shot that day* \[February 20th\]*. In a print interview, Bubenchik previews his admission in Vladimir Tikhii’s documentary film, Brantsy, that he shot and killed two Berkut commanders in the early morning hours of February 20 on the Maidan. … Bubenchik claims that* \[on February 20\] *the Yanukovich regime started the fire in the Trade Union House — where his and many other EuroMaidan fighters lived during the revolt — prompting the Maidan’s next reaction. As noted above, however, pro-Maidan neofascists have revealed that the Right Sector started that fire. … Analysis of the snipers’ massacre shows that the Maidan protesters initiated almost all — at least six out of a possible eight — of the pivotal escalatory moments of violence and/or coercion. … The 30 November 2013 nighttime assault on the Maidan demonstrators is the only clear exception from a conclusive pattern of escalating revolutionary violence led by the Maidan’s relatively small but highly motivated and well-organized neofascist element.”*

Hahn also reveals the CIA had hired snipers from Lithuania, Georgia and Russia to carry out assassinations of demonstrators and turn the protests violent. [A report by Hahn can be seen here.](https://gordonhahn.com/2016/03/09/the-real-snipers-massacre-ukraine-february-2014-updatedrevised-working-paper/)

As we can see, this was a concerted effort by the far-right Ukrainian nationalists to overthrow an elected government. It should be noted these nationalists don't necessarily want NATO membership they are more anti-Russian than pro-NATO and it is in this context the following events should be considered. After the Coup and seizure of power in Ukraine by ultra-nationalists Russia immediately began its own campaign of misinformation and fear mongering to instill panic in the Russian population in Ukraine. I hate to use [Wikiepedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donbas_separatism) here and I'll be honest I'm not sure which polls are cited here but a poll in February of 2014 before the coup showed between 20-30% of residents in both Luhansk and Donetsk wanted to join Russia and another poll conducted in March of 2014 showed the figures jumping to nearly 60% after the coup. A similar situation played out in Crimea and I know the legitimacy of these referendums are rightly suspect but at the same time I believe they are accurate and reflect the genuine fear the Russian population felt following the seizing of power by Anti-Russian ultra nationalists not to mention the strategic importance of Sevastopol to Russia. It being only 1 of 2 warm water ports Russia holds, the other being in Syria. Also, between 2018 and 2021 [over 80%](https://ukraine.un.org/sites/default/files/2022-02/Conflict-related%20civilian%20casualties%20as%20of%2031%20December%202021%20%28rev%2027%20January%202022%29%20corr%20EN_0.pdf) of civilian casualties occurred in the Russian separatist regions as noted by the UN. Something which is entirely ignored by western media. [Letters and Politics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiTxlyiKVT0) conducted an interview with renowned journalist Vijay Prashad who does an incredible job of talking about the very real fear the Russian government and people felt at the events unfolding in Ukraine and how the actions taken by Putin make sense, even if they are wrong and unjustifiable.

Between the 2014 coup and the outbreak of war in 2022 Western media was packed with [article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cohen-ukraine-commentary-idUSKBN1GV2TY) after [article](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/ukraine-s-got-a-real-problem-with-far-right-violence-and-no-rt-didn-t-write-this-headline/) after [article](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/neo-nazis-far-right-ukraine/) depicting the severe problem far-right extremists pose to Ukraine and its stability. [Here](https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/opinion/eu-s-acceptance-of-ukraine-s-radical-svoboda-party-is-shameful/) is an article even calling out the EU for recognizing the interm government in Ukraine following the ouster of Yanukovych that includes the far-right Svoboda party. A key player in the coup. Then, seemingly over night after the outbreak of war in early 2022 the [narrative was turned on its head](https://nationalpost.com/opinion/adam-zivo-no-ukraine-does-not-have-a-neo-nazi-problem) and the far right was no longer an issue. Ukrainian president Volodomyr Zelenskyy and his faith have been a key factor used in the media and the west to down play the influence the far right has over the Ukrainian government. Following the coup many high-ranking members of the perpetrators would go on to occupy high-level offices in the country and obviously the presidency itself through Yatsenyuk,

For his part, Zelenskyy was actually seemingly committed to peace and honoring the Minsk agreements of 2015 as seen in his campaign. In [October 2019](https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/im-not-a-loser-zelensky-clashes-with-veterans-over-donbas-disengagement.html) Zelenksyy clashed with Ukrainian militants in the frontline town of Zolote in an effort to pursue disengagement and disarming the soldiers there. Azov Battalion leader Andriy Biletski responded with a threat saying he would bring even more fighters to the town and a Ukrainian law-maker of former President Poroshenko's party even stated;

\> “Mr. President thinks he is immortal,” she said in a video shared on  Facebook. “A grenade may explode there, by chance. And it would be the nicest if this happened during Moscow’s shelling when someone comes to  the front line wearing a white or blue shirt.”

This was followed by another interview with now former Right-Sector leader and the then \*Commander of the Ukrainian volunteer army\* Dmytro Yarosh. [Unfortunately, only a Ukrainian version is archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20220226040344/https://incident.obozrevatel.com/crime/dmitrij-yarosh-esli-zelenskij-predast-ukrainu-poteryaet-ne-dolzhnost-a-zhizn.htm) but the biggest revelations into the militant mindset comes to light here.

I [found a small excerpt translated here](https://www.moonofalabama.org/2022/03/zelensky-and-the-fascists-he-will-hang-on-some-tree-on-khreshchatyk.html#more) and they show that Yarosh, and the far-right extremists viewed the Minks agreements simply as a tool to bide time and build enough weapons and personnel to overwhelm the separatist regions. He also directly threatened Zelenskyy by hanging if Zelenskyy pursues peace under the Minsk agreements. And his views of Zelenskyy are pretty clear in his next statement;

\> ""Let's fight and get ready. We are waiting for what he will say  and, most importantly, how he will act. By their fruits you will know  them,"" says Scripture. ""Fruits"" we will see somewhere in the fall.  Zelensky is an inexperienced politician. \*And the retinue makes the king.\*  And we already see who is there, ""in the retinue"", is beginning to  appear. It does not add optimism. Because Zelensky promised his voters  (I was not Zelensky's voter) that he would break the oligarchic system.  But already from the first appointments, we see that the oligarchic  system continues to live and flourish. And, obviously, it will continue  to be so. Just the streams will be transferred.

Also, significantly, as noted in the above page is the fact that at this point the openly Neo-Nazi Azov battalion has already been incorporated into the Ukrainian military and police units. We see a clear rift between Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian military and as evidenced by the ongoing war, we know which side prevailed. Not to mention the fact the [United States and Ukraine](https://www.plenglish.com/news/2021/12/17/us-and-ukraine-vote-against-anti-nazi-resolution-repudiated-at-un/) were the only 2 countries to vote against a 2021 UN resolution banning Nazi glorification and white washing of Nazi history.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic [a 2019 paper](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR3063.html) by the RAND corporation funded by the Pentagon detailed Russian vulnerabilities and potential strategies in combating Russia and acknowledged the ongoing power struggle with Russia. A key finding in the report mentions Russian reliance on it's energy exports as well as the relatively small Russian economy being unable to match that of the US. This is eerily reminiscent of the exact strategies being carried out against Russia in the real world. Since it's inception in 2011, Nord Stream 2 has been a source of great angst for the United States in competing for energy exports to Europe. US politicians constantly bemoan and warn against European reliance on Russian Natural Gas and the US sanctioned any company involved with the project. Despite the fact that Russian gas already makes up a vast majority of European imports, it just goes through Ukraine. And thus, we come to the next pawn in the geo-political game. Ukraine is important to Russia because a large portion of the Russian energy distribution system exists in Ukraine. With Nord Stream 2 bypassing Ukraine entirely it would severely weaken Ukrainian relevance to the Russian economy and as a result, weaken the leverage the US would hold over Russia in the event Ukraine were to join NATO.

In [January 2022,](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60151839) 1 month before the \*provoked\* Russian invasion of Ukraine the US issued a warning to Russia saying it would ""Axe"" Nordstream 2 in the event of war. Roughly 8 months later in September 2022, Nordstream 2 suffered a series of explosions that destroyed all but 1 of its transport lines. [CATO institute released an article](https://www.cato.org/commentary/who-attacked-nord-stream-2#) in October 2022 questioning the unfounded claim by the West that Russia sabotaged its own pipeline. Then, [in November](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/11/1/russia-accuses-uk-of-directing-nord-stream-blasts) Russia responded with an accusation blaming the UK for the attack on Nordstream 2. Something that was immediately dismissed as false and a distraction from the war. The narrative around these 2 identical, yet opposing claims should be acknowledged here. Neither side provided any proof behind their claims yet it's commonly believed Russia did indeed destroy its own pipeline and intentionally crippled its most valuable export. Even though it could simply turn the supply of gas on and off at will. Which, lets be honest, it has done in the past. Ultimately we need to remember Russia does have imperial ambitions of its own but the point of this is to acknowledge American provocations. [Donald Trump was persistent in pursuing energy deals with European markets.](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/06/trump-natural-gas-europe-leaders.html)

Whatever your opinion the fact is [American companies have been rejoicing](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/commodities/us-natural-gas-exports-europe-surge-energy-crisis-trader-profits-2022-8) at the expense of consumers. American Natural Gas exports to Europe are up by 60% compared to just last year and shipments are exceeding $200 MILLION. Also comes the fact that energy prices at home are soaring and companies are benefiting from a manufactured scarcity of Natural Gas. American consumers are footing the bill for US corporate imperialism.

[In April of 2022](https://multipolarista.com/2022/09/03/west-peace-proposal-ukraine-russia/) a Ukrainian newspaper (Ukrainska Pravda) reported that possible talks between Zelenskyy and Putin were called off after a sudden visit from UK's Boris Johnson. The paper cited sources saying that Johnson dissuaded Zelenskyy from meeting with Putin on the basis that Putin is a criminal and should not be negotiated with, (A fair point) and that ""They"" are not ready to sign peace agreements. By ""they"" Johnson obviously means himself and the US. Initially, apparently...Johnson and the West felt Zelenskyy should flee Ukraine but were pleasantly surprised at the dysfunction of the Russian military and saw an opportunity.

Backing up a bit and flipping over to Military side we can go back to 2015 when Former United States Secretary of the Treasury Larry Summers summed it up quite nicely at the annual YES meeting by saying “Ukraine is an essential outpost for our fundamental military interests."" [This sentiment was re-iterated](https://apnews.com/article/putin-zelenskyy-washington-4d5fc23be5518e689fbbcac334769d59) just a few weeks ago by Republican Senator Mitch McConnell when he said;

\>  “Continuing our support for Ukraine is morally right, but it is not only  that. It is also a direct investment in cold, hard, American interests,”

I think we all know what he means by this...cold, hard CASSSHHHH BABY!!, and the $50 billion already sent to Ukraine only serve to act as confirmation.

This is a proxy war being funded and encouraged by the US military industrial complex. It is using Ukrainians as cannon fodder and profitting hugely while weakening Russia at the same time. Similar tactics were used by the CIA the world over. Former CIA agent John Stockwell provided a nice quote in his book. He writes;

>You  can change the names in my book \[about Angola\] and you've got  Nicaragua.... the basic structure, all the way through including the  mining of harbors, we addressed all of these issues. The point is that  the U.S. led the way at every step of the escalation of the fighting. We  said it was the Soviets and the Cubans that were doing it. It was the  U.S. that was escalating the fighting. There would have been no war if  we hadn't gone in first. We put arms in, they put arms in. We put  advisors in, they answered with advisors. We put in Zairian para-  commando battalions, they put in Cuban army troops. We brought in the S.  African army, they brought in the Cuban army. And they pushed us away.  They blew us away because we were lying, we were covering ourselves with  lies, and they were telling the truth. And it was not a war that we  could fight. We didn't have interests there that should have been  defended that way.

Although the USSR is no longer here the CIA is. And they are still up to their same old antics.

This is a war being fought between 2 oligarchies over market control under the guise of freedom and democracy. The US doesn't care about the Ukrainian people, it only cares about what pushes the bottom line higher. The rhetoric lately has hardened even further as well. [Russia has repeatedly stated](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/12/23/putins-call-to-end-war-in-ukraine-slammed-by-us-as-insincere) it is willing to negotiate peace on the condition NATO leaves Ukraine something that is immediately refused. I believe the desire for peace is genuine but the West's ultimatum demanding Russia simply up and leave Ukraine, including the annexed regions is unrealistic. Given the country is under the control of far-right extremists who are fiercely anti-Russian, whether you agree with why or not isn't the point, a Russian withdrawal would almost certainly mean mass violence against any Russians who remain in Donbas or Crimea. Again, civilians paying the price for the actions of greedy governments.

The Ukrainian ultra-nationalists also pose a significant problem for the US as well. In the event Russia is defeated they have shown they are vehemently opposed to foreign intervention of any kind and are simply co-operating with the US so long as it benefits them. They are receiving modern weapons and equipment and have become one of the most competent fighting forces in Europe. Something that will only lead to further conflict with Europe after Russia.

And, my last point is that this war doesn't end with Russia. In the event of a total Russian collapse and the take over of the Russian economy by Western markets China will be completely isolated and surrounded by the US and NATO. [John Pilger's documentary ""The coming war on China](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V42KtSeo3uI)"" goes into great detail on how US imperialism and foreign policy has become increasingly belligerent towards China over the last 15 or so years and the early stages of this are being seen with the current tensions surrounding Taiwan. With Russia out of the way China will be the last major obstacle to the US in total world domination.

However it's painfully apparent now how in shambles our medical system is. Long waits, no doctors, people giving birth at home, etc.

My mom recently went to Thailand and her back went out and she was absolutely glowing about how great her experience was in a Thai hospital. She saw a doctor immediately, got a private room for seven days, etc etc. She went to a private hospital and now she's home spouting the magic of ""Privatization is the way to go!"" I tried to look it up to see if the average Thai citizen was receiving the same care, and they do have public care but it's not nearly as good as what my mom experienced, so obviously she is enjoying colonial benefit of being a rich foreigner in a poor country I assume?

I have a friend who's mom died of cancer 10 years ago and she always brings that up saying ""If my mom were in the states we could've paid to save her life but she died here waiting.""

It's such a touchy subject to talk to people about because it's directly relating their health or the death of a loved one, but yes would love to discuss the following points:

What the hell happened?

What can be done to fix this?

There absolutely are. Reform immigration policy and education coordination with industry. As it is there are massive loopholes through the TFW program and the education paper mill to excuse the significant shortfalls in education funding nationwide. It *needs* to be what it's *supposed* to be, a supplement to labour shortfalls which we are incapable of (not unwilling to) filling ourselves.

It's not ""punching down."" It's fixing the oversupply of labour which allows exploitation of Canadian citizens. If you threw citizenship at literally everyone who wanted it (not suggesting that's what you're saying) then you just increase the number of Canadians who can be exploited. More citizenship cards doesn't fix the problem, it exacerbates it. Controlling our labour pool to give better negotiating power does. You need to think of the country like one big union which exists for the benefit of its workers.

>If the state was responsible to guarantee a baseline quality of life / access to food, shelter and various markers of prosperity regardless of permanent resident or citizen, it would stop being cheaper for them to exploit immigrants.

To borrow your own odd use of the ""One Big Union"" adage: They're all workers, they're all working with you.

Not at all. You have to get your house in order before you can clean up anywhere else. Add more people and it's just more people for businesses to exploit. Force the government to cover ""basic needs"" and basic needs will be redefined to mean the most inhuman conditions they can possibly get away with. And as much as I wish we lived in some post-national fantasy world, we don't. We live in the real world and it takes work to get there, not just pretending we're there already.

As I said prior, there are much more socialist government which have robust economies and slow population decline. We can and should mimic them instead of pretending that trying to pack as many people in as possible and worsening living standards is somehow a laudable goal. It is not.

**Strawman.** You're misrepresenting what I said previously as though it's somehow setting different kinds of labour against one another when the discussion was about the lack of physical labourers in the modern labour movement. I was pointing out the qualitative differences in the danger and effort of physical versus non-physical labour. That is not oppositional at all. You're just continuing to misrepresent my position.

> ""Dragging the baseline down"" as a reply to the idea that the state should be responsible to ensure that all people have equitable access to food, housing, water, and healthcare (including such luxury resources like ""Dental""), is a fairly conservative point to try to make.

**Strawman and ad hominem rolled together.** That's not a conservative point. It's reflective of what happens 9/10 times when the government is put in charge of providing something because of the massive bureaucratic bloat. You get a pair of shitty army boots which cost cost about $60 to make and cost the government $300 a pair.

>You may want to consider the place you're having this discussion.

You might want to consider not blatantly misrepresenting what someone is saying because you find it more convenient to attack a different argument as opposed to the one they're actually making.

>It presumes that the extant divide between labour and capital is because of a zero sum game in which all wealth is circulating, as opposed to large amounts of it captured in what amounts to ""millionaire/billionaire dick measuring"" and other sorts of grifts

Within a nation it is a zero-sum game regardless of your revenue capture from taxes. Even if you could (and we should) make the wealthy pay their fair share, there's still a finite resource pool in terms of cash and physical constraints like farmland, living space, etc.

>I was suggesting that the state would have to be held accountable to provide the full benefits of citizenship to any foreign labour they decided to exploit however transiently or tenuously.

So increasing the burden on national funds and still driving down wages and up housing. That makes the current problem worse for Canadians, not better.

>Part of how that labour is allowed to undermine our own is dependent on their need/desire to be here, and their willingness to tolerate exploitation to realize that need/desire. Remove the perverse incentive, you functionally remove the pervert.

That's only true to a small extent. See the push down of wages in the trucking sector, or any other which has seen a flood of imported labour drive wages down.

>To borrow your own odd use of the ""One Big Union"" adage: They're all workers, they're all working with you. Are they going to be willing to stick their neck out and strike when there is the threat of deportation?

Take away the tenuousness of their ability to remain in the country, and the intrinsic threat of deportation to whatever circumstance they decided to emigrate from, and you have a worker more likely to be able to take part in the labour struggle.

And you have 1000 people competing for a job instead of 10, driving wages down. It's one big union in that the nation exists for the benefit of its citizens, until such time as we can move beyond nation states. But we're nowhere near that point yet and making life worse for Canadians doesn't get us there.

>Most labour reforms required mass and sometimes violent action. If we can adequately welcome and protect our new ""union"" brothers and sisters, and turn them against the hand of capital, they aren't bringing in scabs, they're bolstering the numbers of an army.

You realize that as we've gained more people the public has actually become *more* docile, right?

>It sucks to have to deal with that, and I can see how that would seem far more work than just ""No more immigrants""

**Strawman.** I never said ""no more immigrants."" What I said was to have the system work as intended, as supplement to labour we cannot produce within our education system. Not as a replacement for it.

>Not even the world's shittiest conservative will stop the flow of international workers, they'll just ""gerrymander"" the origins to selectively try to bolster their secondary social point of schism, and along the way they'll pick your pocket and hamstring infrastructure to justify self-enriching privatization.

Because we don't have any good government to represent labour, or housing, or deal with debt, or any of the myriad of issues facing the country.

1. Find a college (not university) program here you can get in to (still not cheap as a foreigner) in a relatively in demand field. A trades program would be good right now and it's decent money for very little education. So study permit/college is the first thing.
2. While in school you can legally only work a set amount of hours, but people work more under the table and often end up getting abused by employers *but* it can sometimes help lead into #3.
3. Job search while here so you get a job offer at the end with an actual work permit. That lets you stay and work.
4. Because you now have education and experience in an in-demand field it makes the application for PR faster.
5. After that you basically stay the required duration for the residency requirement, apply for citizenship, pass the test, take the oath, and that's it.

I know a ton of people who've done this, lots of people I worked with, and a least two of every five guys when I went back to college.",uhsthn,Comment,5,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadaleft/comments/uhsthn/us_leftist_easiest_way_to_immigrate_to_canada/i78jgr2/,"""Electric Trains N O W""",,0.11739369,0.004615784,0.06395709,0.10221587,0.03511308,0.008712323,0.072458791,0.043,0.038,0.919,0.2725,N/A,N/A,N/A,en

Canada has a 'point system' for people that want to go to live there but can't apply as refugee. If you have a highly demanded profession in Canada (the population of that country is getting old at a very fast pace) you will have more points.

Are you HIV+ or diabetic? Forget about moving to Canada unless you have an insurance that will cover for the cost of your treatments. Your demand will be immediately rejected as you are considered an 'excessive burden' for the public healthcare system there.

The process can be lengthy and you have to spend money (if your demand is rejected, that money won't be refunded).

Are you planning to marry a Canadian? Well, that doesn't mean automatic permission to move there. Your partner need to sponsor your case (and it can be rejected because of an chronic condition).",uhsthn,Comment,2,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadaleft/comments/uhsthn/us_leftist_easiest_way_to_immigrate_to_canada/i7852au/,"""None""",,0.19124292,0.004882813,0.023652986,0.10757765,0.082619295,0.006861079,0.20365530303030308,0.073,0.132,0.795,-0.9377,N/A,N/A,N/A,en
